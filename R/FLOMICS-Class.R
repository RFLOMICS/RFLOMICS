#' @title \link{ExpDesign-class} Class
#' @description
#' This class, is an internal class to the RFLOMICS package. An object of this class stores all the
#' objects related to the experimental design setup and the statistical modeling of the data.
#' This informations are required to run the omics analysis and this object is an input to
#' the \link{FlomicsMultiAssay.constructor.}
#' @slot ExpDesign  An object of class data.frame. Row names must give the name of each sample which has been to be construct
#' by combining factor's modality separated by a "_" (EX: WT_treated_rep1). Column are vector of character storing the factor
#' madality for each sample. Column names give the name of the experimental factor.
#' @slot List.Factors A named List of factor giving the modality of the experimental factor for each sample.
#' @slot Factors.Type A named vector of character giving the type of effect of each factor. Two types of effect are required
#' ("Bio" or "batch")
#' @slot Groups An object of class data.frame. Row names give the name of each sample which has been to be construct
#' by combining factor's modality separated by a "_" (EX: WT_treated_rep1). Two columns, the first one give the group
#' of the sample by concatenating all factor modality except the replicat. The second one give the name of the sample.
#' @slot Model.formula An object of class formula.
#' @slot Contrasts.List A list of data.frame giving all the hypothesis (contrasts) that can be formulated according to a model.
#' This list is generated thanks to the \link{getExpressionContrast} method. Three type of contrasts could be generated: simple,
#' averaged, interaction. For details see the help of the \link{getExpressionContrast} method.
#' @slot Contrasts.Sel A data.frame giving the hypothesis (contrasts) that the user selected through the interface.
#' @slot projectName A vector of character giving the name of the project.
#' @slot Contrasts.Coeff An object of class data.frame giving the coefficient for each contrast.
#' @return ExpDesign
#' @seealso \link{getExpressionContrast}
