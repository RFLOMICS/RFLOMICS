Description: R-package with shiny interface, provides a framework for 
    the analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics and/or metabolomics data. 
    The interface offers a guided experience for the user, from the definition
    of the experimental design to the integration of several omics table together.
    A report can be generated with all settings and analysis results.
