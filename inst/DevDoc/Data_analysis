Proteomics Data Analysis:
ProteoSign: an end-user online differential proteomics statistical analysis platform (NAR, 2017)

1) Get Protein intensities (MassChroqR)
2) Remove noisy Proteins (MassChroqR)

3) Log2-transform the protein intensities and perform quantile normalization across replicates and conditions via the normalizeBetweenArrays function, which is available from the LIMMA R library as part of Bioconductor

normalizeBetweenArrays(object, method="quantile")

4) Fit a linear model for each protein via the lmFit function (LIMMA) taking into account the estimated correlation (calculated via the duplicate Correlation function) (LIMMA) between technical replicates, if any.

fit <- lmFit(M,design=design)

5) Compute the contrasts from the model fit and summary statistics via the contrasts.fit and eBayes functions(LIMMA).

fit2 <- contrasts.fit(fit,contrast.matrix)
fit2 <- eBayes(fit2)
